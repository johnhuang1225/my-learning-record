## Isomorphic

Isomorphic refers to using the same code on the frontend and the backend; that is, using the same API everywhere (frontend, backend, and even for mobile apps). For example, a piece of isomorphic code is Meteor.logOut(); calling this piece of code would work the same on the frontend and the backend, and even in your mobile Meteor apps. You can think of isomorphic as homogeneous (of the same kind).
