## Importing from packages

In Meteor, it is also simple and straightforward to use the import syntax to load npm packages on the client or server and access the packageâ€™s exported symbols as you would with any other module. You can also import from Meteor Atmosphere packages, but the import path must be prefixed with meteor/ to avoid conflict with the npm package namespace. For example, to import moment from npm and HTTP from Atmosphere:

```js
import moment from 'moment';          // default import from npm
import { HTTP } from 'meteor/http';   // named import from Atmosphere
```
