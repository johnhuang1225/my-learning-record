## Hot code push

Live browser reload (also known as hot code load and hot code push) not only automatically reloads your live web page whenever you make development changes on the frontend (HTML, CSS, images, JavaScript, etc.), but it also automatically refreshes just the necessary DOM elements on the page (without reloading the entire page), even when there are dependent changes to data on the backend (MongoDB) or frontend (Minimongo).
