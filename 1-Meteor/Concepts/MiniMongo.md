## MiniMongo

Meteor comes with mini-databases that simulate an actual database inside the browser. The miniature database for MongoDB is called Minimongo, an in-memory, nonpersistent implementation of MongoDB in pure JavaScript. It doesn’t rely on HTML5 Local Storage because it exists only in the browser’s memory.
